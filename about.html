        <h2>The Mardi Gras Hisyory</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and
            18th
            centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted
            calf,
            followed France to her colonies. </p>
        <p>
            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
            ground 60
            miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the
            eve of the
            festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In
            1703, the
            tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras. </p>
        <p>
            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current
            Mardi Gras
            krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
            1861. The
            procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with
            an actual
            bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday. </p>
        <p>
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
            Orleans, but not
            with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
            established elegant
            society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today. </p>
        <p>
            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing
            body. That
            year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival
            organizations
            formed in New Orleans. </p>
        <p>
            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
            celebrate Mardi
            Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an
            exciting air
            of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John
            Milton's
            hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
            floats (known
            as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous. </p>

            As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the excitement of
            Mardi Gras! The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also
            called Twelfth
            Night or
            Kingsâ€™ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival
            clubs,
            called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly
            learn to
            say, "Throw me something mister!"
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club and
            the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled day
            of excitement
            for revelers of all ages.
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
            New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to be at
            any time of
            the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your plans now
            to be a part
            of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"
